# Netflix Clone

This is a simple website that looks like Netflix. I made it with just HTML and CSS.

# What’s in This Project?

 1. **Home Page** ("index.html"): Has the Netflix logo, a welcome message, and a button to see movies.
 2. **Movies Page** ("movies.html"): Shows some  movie cards in a grid.
 3. **Styles** ("styles.css"): Gives the website its colors and layout.

# How to Run

1. Download the files to your computer.
2. Open **index.html** in any web browser.
3. Click “Browse Movies” to see the movies page.
